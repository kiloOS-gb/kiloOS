# kiloOS

Welcome to the *kiloOS* repo! This is a OS based on Arch Linux that is coming soon! (expected summer 2025!) 

# Key Features

kiloOS will feature privacy, and quite a lot of it, kiloOS is dedicated to everyones privacy and we believe that privacy is a fundimental right to everyone. We wouldn't collect **any** personal data when you use kiloOS. 

We will also feature a lot of security features such as, File Locker, (where you can protect any file with a simple password, and if you forget it, tough luck. **your data is gone** without that password), Password security to the maximum! (you can choose not to have a password, but we strongly discourage it, and when you decide to choose a password, we take it to the max. you will need 8 characters, symbols, numbers, the whole lot! We are dedicated to your security.)

# Questions that may be asked

1. **When will these features come?**

Well right now theres nothing, We are plannning to gradually release these features in upcoming updates, and its tough to say when exactly, but be on the lookout on our X page and TikTok page for release dates and sneak peaks!

2. **How often will you update?**

So I am a secondary school student, so my time isnt that flexible, but I plan to work on this project everyday when I get back from school and on weekends, and on holidays too! 

3. **Will this be a reskin of some random Linux distro?**

As of right now, **absolutely not**. I am planning to do my own desktop interface which will be hard, hence why its expected in Summer 2025. I am not **one of them** people who reskin a linux distro and glaze it on their TikTok page. **you know who you are.**

# **Where can I find updates about this project?**

@kiloos.official on both TikTok and X. It may expand to more social media platforms soon but I doubt it.
