# kiloOS

Welcome to the *kiloOS* repo! This is a OS based on Arch Linux that is coming soon! (expected summer 2025!) 

# Key Features

kiloOS will feature privacy, and quite a lot of it, kiloOS is dedicated to everyones privacy and we believe that privacy is a fundimental right to everyone. We wouldn't collect **any** personal data when you use kiloOS. 

We will also feature a lot of security features such as, File Locker, (where you can protect any file with a simple password, and if you forget it, tough luck. your data is gone without that password), Password security to the maximum! (you can choose not to have a password, but we strongly discourage it, and when you decide to choose a password, we take it to the max. you will need 8 characters, symbols, numbers, the whole lot! We are dedicated to your security.)
